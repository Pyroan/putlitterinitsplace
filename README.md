# Put Litter in its Place

> A just okay game about trash.

One of the official names for this emoji ðŸš® is "Put Litter in Its Place" and I thought that'd be a fun theme for a game so here we are.

## Download
[Download on itch.io](https://chiptopher.itch.io/put-litter-in-its-place)

## Build

The game is made using [LÃ–VE](https://love2d.org/), so you're gonna need that. After you have that, and have pulled down the repository, then you should be able to just `love .` in the root directory.

## Contribute

That'd be an interesting choice, but I'd look at a PR if you put one in.
