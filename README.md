## Build

The game is made using [LÃ–VE](https://love2d.org/), so you're gonna need that. After you have that, and have pulled down the repository, then you should be able to just `love .` in the root directory.

## Contribute

That'd be an interesting choice, but I'd look at a PR if you put one in.
